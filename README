This is a shell app I created for a children's story book on iOS. It basically just shows a bunch of pictures with text on top, and has all the necessary page turn effects and that kind of stuff. The template works for both iPad and iPhone and requires iOS 5. I'm too lazy to even explain what's happening, but it's not too complicated. I'm just putting this up to maybe save someone the time later.
